# MOROS LIGHT - STYLOMETRY OBFUSCATOR

**MOROS LIGHT** is a real-time, lightweight stylometry obfuscator.  
It listens to your keyboard input and randomly replaces words with synonyms from a dictionary, helping disguise word-choice patterns that stylometry tools rely on.

---

##  Features
- Random synonym replacement using `dictionary.txt`
- Adjustable replacement chance (default: 80%)
- Simple hotkey controls:
  - **F12** → Toggle on/off  
  - **Ctrl+Up** → Increase replacement chance  
  - **Ctrl+Down** → Decrease replacement chance  
- Fully customizable dictionary of words and replacements  




##  Usage
Just run the file named run.bat or run the python file for the non admin version (may break the script)

Then just start typing anywhere (chat, editor, terminal, etc).
Then Moros may swap the words for synonyms.



##  Compatibility
Windows ✅ Works out of the box

Linux ⚠️ Requires sudo for keyboard hooks

macOS ❌ Not supported (blocked by OS-level restrictions)


## Future
This is the LIGHT version of Moros.
A full stylometry obfuscator could also adjust:

Sentence structure

Punctuation variation

Grammar (active/passive)

Sentence length and rhythm
